## Overview

This project is brought to you by Evan R. Venn and Angel Mier.

This extension provides syntax highlighting, IntelliSense auto-completion, bracket completion, outline object generation, code snippets, and lexer/parser error detection for the GCBasic language. GCBasic is a compiler for 8-bit PIC, ATMEL, and LGT microcontrollers and is part of the GC Studio toolchain.

This extension also provides a sidebar with options to compile and flash, make HEX, or make ASM files.

To compile and have all tasks enabled, GC Studio should be installed on the system. [Get GC Studio for Windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gcbasic/files/GCStudio%20-%20Complete%20IDE%20and%20Toolchain%20for%20Windows/GCstudioSetup.exe/download)

GCBasic has support for more than 1,275 chip parts, 128+ powerful libraries, 1,291+ example code files and demos, and extensive, well-written documentation.
